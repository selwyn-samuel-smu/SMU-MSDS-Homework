The purpose of this repository is to store all the homework that is done as part of the Masters program for Data Science at SMU.

There will be subdirectories for each of the homework. The subdirectories will have the course number and the unit number in the title. For example: 6306-Unit4 will denote the homework that was done as part of course 6306 and Unit 4.
